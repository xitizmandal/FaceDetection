# FaceDetection
Detect human faces and put variety of filters over the detected face. 

Viola Jones Robust Real-Time Face Detection process was the chosen implementation methodology which included the following processes -->

1. Image Input
2. Grayscale & Histogram equalization
3. Sub-imaging with pyramid structure
4. Integral Images
5. Extracting HAAR like features
6. Adaptivie Boosting (AdaBoost)
7. Classifier 
8. Face Detection
